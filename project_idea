We aim to generate a 3D home structure using  models from Clarifai.
The process involves analyzing images of homes through GPT-4 Vision model from Clarifai.
Subsequently, GPT-4 Turbo would be utilized to gather user input for the dimensions of the home. 
Finally, for displaying the home, the DALL-E model would be employed.
